# NetBox Azure AD Groups Plugin - User Stories & Project Plan

## User Stories

### Primary Users: NetBox Administrators & IT Operations
**As a NetBox administrator, I want to:**
- Import Azure AD security groups into NetBox so I can track organizational structure
- View group memberships for both contacts AND devices to understand complete access patterns
- Assign multiple groups to any contact or device (many-to-many relationships)
- Filter contacts and devices by one or more group memberships for targeted operations
- Sync group data automatically via API endpoints for up-to-date information
- Manage groups through NetBox's web interface alongside existing resources
- See all groups a contact/device belongs to in a single view
- See all contacts/devices that belong to a specific group

### Secondary Users: External Tools & Automation
**As an automation tool, I want to:**
- Query group information via REST API for integration workflows
- Update group memberships programmatically for both contacts and devices during sync
- Handle bulk membership operations efficiently
- Access standardized data structure compatible with Microsoft Graph API
- Support multi-group assignments in API operations

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation & Analysis
1. **Research & Design** - Study NetBox plugin architecture and existing `netbox_invoices` plugin
2. **Data Modeling** - Design Django models supporting many-to-many relationships for both contacts and devices
3. **Project Structure** - Set up plugin skeleton following NetBox conventions

### Phase 2: Core Implementation  
4. **Database Layer** - Implement models with proper many-to-many relationships and migrations
5. **API Layer** - Build REST serializers and viewsets supporting bulk operations
6. **Web Interface** - Create templates and views for multi-group management

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Testing
7. **Advanced Features** - Add multi-group filtering, search, and relationship displays
8. **Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive unit tests for models and APIs
9. **Packaging** - Final plugin packaging and documentation

## Key Design Decisions

**Models:**
- `AzureGroup` - Core group entity with Azure AD metadata
- `GroupMembership` - Generic foreign key supporting both Contact and Device models
- Many-to-many relationships allowing unlimited group assignments per entity

**API Design:**
- Follow NetBox REST API conventions
- Microsoft Graph API compatible data structures
- Bulk operations for efficient sync of multi-group assignments
- Support for filtering by multiple groups simultaneously

**Security:**
- Read-only group data (managed by Azure AD)
- Proper Django permissions integration
- Audit logging for all membership changes

**Multi-Group Support:**
- No artificial limits on group assignments
- Efficient querying for entities with multiple group memberships
- UI support for managing multiple group relationships
- API endpoints supporting bulk group operations

This approach ensures flexible group management while maintaining NetBox plugin standards and supporting complex organizational structures where entities belong to multiple groups.
