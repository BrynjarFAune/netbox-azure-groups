# RBAC Extension Project Brief

## Project Overview
Extend the existing `netbox-azure-groups` plugin to provide comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) documentation and tracking capabilities across multiple authorization systems.

## Current State
- **Plugin Name**: `netbox-azure-groups`
- **Location**: `C:\Users\brynjar.aune\Proj\internal\netbox-plugin\aad-groups\`
- **Current Functionality**: 
  - Azure AD group tracking (`AzureGroup` model)
  - Group membership management (`GroupMembership`, `GroupOwnership`)
  - Support for both Azure AD and on-premises AD
  - REST API and web interface for group management
  - Integration with NetBox contacts and devices

## Project Goal
Transform the plugin from simple "Azure group tracking" to comprehensive "RBAC documentation system" that tracks:
- **Who** has access (users, service accounts, devices)
- **What** permissions they have (across multiple systems)  
- **Where** permissions come from (direct assignment vs group membership)
- **When** permissions were granted and when they expire
- **Why** permissions were granted (business justification)

## Extension Requirements

### 1. Multi-System Support
Extend beyond just Azure AD to track permissions in:
- Azure Active Directory (existing)
- On-premises Active Directory (existing)
- AWS IAM
- Google Workspace
- Okta
- Application-specific systems
- Database systems
- Network devices

### 2. New Data Models Required
- **RBACSystem**: Register and categorize authorization systems
- **RBACPermission**: Catalog individual permissions/roles per system
- **ServiceAccount**: Track non-human identities and their permissions
- **RBACAssignment**: Link permissions to assignees with metadata

### 3. Permission Assignment Tracking
- Direct permission assignments
- Group-based permission inheritance  
- Time-limited permissions with expiration dates
- Approval workflows for privileged permissions
- Audit trails for all permission changes

### 4. Reporting and Compliance
- Dashboard showing system-wide permission overview
- Expiration alerts for time-bound permissions
- Privileged permission usage tracking
- Cross-system permission correlation
- Compliance reporting for auditors

## Implementation Approach
**Strategy**: Extend existing plugin rather than create new co-dependent plugin

**Benefits**:
- Leverages existing Azure group infrastructure
- Maintains unified API and web interface
- Direct relationships with existing models
- Single plugin deployment and maintenance

## Technical Architecture

### Database Layer
- 4 new Django models extending NetBoxModel
- Foreign key relationships to existing AzureGroup model
- Proper indexing for performance
- Support for custom fields and tags

### API Layer  
- REST API endpoints for all new models
- Bulk operations for sync tool integration
- Filtering and search capabilities
- GraphQL support (optional)

### Web Interface
- CRUD interfaces for all models
- RBAC dashboard with metrics
- Integration with existing contact/device pages
- Permission assignment workflows

## Success Criteria
1. **Complete Documentation**: All employee and service account permissions tracked across systems
2. **Audit Compliance**: Full audit trail with justifications and approval workflows
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Automated alerts for expiring permissions
4. **Cross-System Visibility**: Single pane of glass for all RBAC information
5. **Integration Ready**: API endpoints for external sync and compliance tools

## Deliverables

### Phase 1 (Foundation)
- Extended Django models with migrations
- Database schema updates
- Basic model validation and relationships

### Phase 2 (API Layer)  
- REST API serializers and viewsets
- URL routing and endpoint configuration
- Filtering and search capabilities
- API testing and documentation

### Phase 3 (Web Interface)
- CRUD templates and forms
- Navigation menu updates  
- Basic list/detail views
- Integration with existing pages

### Phase 4 (Advanced Features)
- RBAC dashboard with metrics
- Permission assignment workflows
- Expiration alerts and notifications
- Reporting and compliance views

### Phase 5 (Integration)
- External sync tool APIs
- Webhook integrations
- Advanced visualization
- Automated compliance reporting

## Technical Specifications
- **NetBox Version**: 3.0+
- **Python Version**: 3.12+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Django ORM)
- **Framework**: Django with NetBox plugin architecture
- **API**: Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: NetBox template system with Bootstrap

## Resource Requirements
- **Development Time**: 5-6 weeks for core functionality
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, API tests
- **Documentation**: API docs, user guide updates
- **Migration**: Data migration planning for existing installations

## Risk Mitigation
- **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Performance**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive model validation
- **Security**: Follow NetBox permission model
- **Scalability**: Designed for large datasets

## Success Metrics
- All corporate RBAC systems integrated and documented
- 100% of employees and service accounts tracked
- Zero missed permission expirations due to automated alerts
- Audit compliance achieved with full documentation trail
- Reduced time to complete access reviews by 75%

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve technical specification
2. Set up development environment and branch
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation (database models)
4. Iterative development with regular testing
5. Staged rollout with existing Azure group functionality preserved
