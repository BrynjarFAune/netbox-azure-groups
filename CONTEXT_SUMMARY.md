# Project Context Summary

## What We Built
Transformed NetBox Azure Groups plugin into comprehensive **access control documentation system** specifically for **FortiGate + Azure AD environments**.

## Core Achievement  
✅ **Complete API layer** for documenting "who has access to what resources and how"
✅ **FortiGate policy integration** with 336 real policies fetched and parsed
✅ **AI-generated policy descriptions** for human-readable documentation
✅ **Resource-centric design** focused on actual use case vs generic RBAC

## Key Models Created
1. **ProtectedResource** - Database, applications, physical locations needing access control
2. **AccessControlMethod** - How access is granted (FortiGate policies, badge readers, etc.)  
3. **AccessGrant** - Computed tracking of who has access via which Azure groups
4. **FortiGatePolicy** - Complete firewall policy representation with AI descriptions

## Real Data Integration
- **FortiGate**: 10.0.101.1:4443 (336 policies fetched)
- **NetBox**: brynjar@10.0.123.5:8000 (API deployed)
- **Use Case**: Document FortiGate policies that grant access to resources based on Azure AD group membership

## Next Phase
**Web Interface** - Build forms and enhanced detail pages for manual management of access control data.

The foundation is solid - complete API with real FortiGate data integration. Ready to build UI on top of this robust backend.
